# Project_2 US Air Pollution Forecasting (2021–2023)

This project analyzes and forecasts daily ozone Air Quality Index (AQI) trends across the United States using EPA open datasets and Prophet time-series modeling.

## Project Overview
- Combined and cleaned daily AQI datasets from 2021–2023
- Built a Prophet model to forecast future ozone AQI for 2024
- Visualized seasonal patterns and future trends
- Created a full IEEE-style research paper summarizing methodology and findings

## Folder Structure
- `/notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks (data cleaning, modeling, forecasting)
- `/data/` — Cleaned datasets and model predictions
- `/figures/` — Forecast visualizations
- `/report/` — Final research paper (IEEE format)

## Key Results
- Forecasted daily ozone AQI for one year ahead
- Identified clear seasonal variations in ozone pollution
- Supported public health planning with actionable predictions

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Prophet)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- EPA Air Data (2021–2023)
